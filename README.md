The goal of this project is to integrate New York Cityâ€™s historical weather data, including variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, 
and weather conditions, by building a structured data mart (Data Mart). We hope to provide city managers and researchers with a centralized and unified data platform to 
facilitate the analysis of the impact of weather on urban life (such as traffic, air quality, etc.).

Introduction to file contents:
Most of the csv files in the file are data source files. After downloading and cleaning with download data.py and data cleaning and exploration.ipynb, 
the final data file df_final.csv is obtained. Then, the model fitting related processing is performed with 7-day-future-prediction-model.ipynb to obtain 
the model performance display files performance.csv, smooth_pred.csv, etc. Finally, all the data is visualized with two tableau files, IS525 Final Project.twb 
and LSTM.twbx, to obtain the dashboard display.
